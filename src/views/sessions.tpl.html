            Augmented and virtual reality technologies are impacting every walk
            of life, from business applications to medicine to education to personal
            hobbies. What are the differences between these technologies?
            And more importantly, how can you find uses for them in your personal
            and professional life? Richard Ruth will explore these technologies
            with you and offer some fun and inspirational examples of how basic
            AR works in various application contexts and an overview of how to
            create easy AR apps with free software.

            Many people often have no idea how much "street art" costs and often
            underestimate the cost of having graffiti/mural artists commissioned.
            At the same time, some street artworks may be overpaid or overestimated.
            What is the real price for street art and who in fact benefits from it?

            Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

          </h3>
          <p class="session__desc">
            Do you sometimes feel like a fraud? Perhaps you think that some of
            your successes are undeserved?
            Imposter syndrome makes us think irrationally about our aptitudes
            and performance. The irony is that the further you go in your career,
            the more opportunities there are for imposter syndrome to rear its ugly head.
            The bad news - it's not likely you'll ever be able to fully
            rid yourself of imposter syndrome. But the good news - there are ways
            to combat it! You can train yourself to quickly identify it, manage it,
            and live to rise again.
