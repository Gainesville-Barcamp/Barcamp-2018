            Augmented and virtual reality technologies are impacting every walk
            of life, from business applications to medicine to education to personal
            hobbies. What are the differences between these technologies?
            And more importantly, how can you find uses for them in your personal
            and professional life? Richard Ruth will explore these technologies
            with you and offer some fun and inspirational examples of how basic
            AR works in various application contexts and an overview of how to

            Many people often have no idea how much "street art" costs and often
            underestimate the cost of having graffiti/mural artists commissioned.
            At the same time, some street artworks may be overpaid or overestimated.
            What is the real price for street art and who in fact benefits from it?
